# Indian-Suicide-Statistics---Data-Visualisation
We had a dataset of suicides in each state in India, classified according to various parameters (suicide causes, education status, by means adopted, professional profile, social status) from 2001-2012 by the ​ National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), Govt of India​ . Our goal was to analyse and visualise the suicide data based on causes, demography etc. chronologically to find interesting and useful insights. The analysis and visualisations can help the medical institutions and Governments in understanding the existing scenario and in devising better suicide preventive interventions.

Please refer to [Report.pdf](https://github.com/meghanakotagiri/Indian-Suicide-Statistics---Data-Visualisation/blob/master/Report.pdf) that contains insights gained from the analysis and visualization of the data.
